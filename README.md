This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

# TODO

1. Filter and handle Radio Checks in Addons - DONE
2. Display required and Selected Labels based on state - DONE
3. Calculate price of item keeping in view the addOns - DONE
4. Encapsulate the item finding logic that is repeated nearly 3 times, into its own separate Hook - DONE
5. Make DescriptionModal Responsive
6. Add AddOns options in Cart and calculate total on basis of that.
7. Persist the addOn options of the items in cart in localStorage and global state aswell
8. Check that all required addOns are selected and only then an item should be added to cart

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
